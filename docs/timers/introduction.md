*What is a timer?*

A timer is a kernel object that measures the passage of time using the kernel's system clock. When a timer's specified time limit is reached it can perform an application-defined action, or it can simply record the expiration and wait for the application to read its status.

Any number of timers can be defined (limited only by available RAM)
